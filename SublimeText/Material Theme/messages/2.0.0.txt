🏮 UI THEME

  ➼ Increase sidebar spacing and add new setting to enable old compact sidebar ( "material_theme_compact_sidebar": true )
  ➼ Update some filetype icons
  ➼ Fixed blade icon not showing after the latest updates

🏮 COLOR SCHEME️

  ➼ Oldest color scheme will now be available under OLD folder ( Packages/Material Theme/schemes/OLD/Material-Theme-*.tmTheme )
  ➼ Sass & SCSS lang files removed to avoid issues with the main packages.

🏮 CORE

  ➼ Add a gulp/js compiler to the main theme structure. Now we have to edit source (./src) files and compile by run `$ npm install` and then `$ gulp`
