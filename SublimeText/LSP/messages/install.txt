                  Thanks for trying out the LSP package!
                  ======================================


This package is a "client" implementation of the "language server protocol".
This is a protocol that defines how (language) servers and clients (editors)
should talk to each other. It enables high-quality code-complete,
signature-help, goto-def, accurate find-references, and more.

This package doesn't actually contain any language server by itself. It
provides only the glue code to attach language servers to Sublime Text.

Exactly which concepts from LSP should map to which concepts from Sublime
Text and vice versa is an ongoing research problem. We're certainly still
figuring things out!

To get up and running for your favorite language, open the documentation at
