# An implementation of weak method borrowed from sublime_lib [1]
#
# We need it to be able to weak reference bound methods as `weakref.WeakMethod` is not available in
# 3.3 runtime.
#
# The reason this is necessary is explained in the documentation of `weakref.WeakMethod`:
# > A custom ref subclass which simulates a weak reference to a bound method (i.e., a method defined
# > on a class and looked up on an instance). Since a bound method is ephemeral, a standard weak
# > reference cannot keep hold of it.
