# Features and Fixes

- Add back stippled option for document highlights (#1748) (Janos Wortmann)
- Add command to restart a specific server (#1733) (@husanjun)
  You can restart specific servers now with "LSP: Restart Servers".
  Note that this changed the name of the command; if you had it bound to a
  key binding you should update the key binding.
- When a helper package cannot start the server, continue handling listeners (#1716) (Raoul Wols)
  Fixes a subtle bug where if one language server didn't meet the startup
  requirements, other queued servers wouldn't be handled any more.
- Special-case env.PATH extending to prepend to the original PATH (#1752) (Rafał Chłodnicki)
  In preparation for fixing a subtle bug for helper packages that rely on Node.js
  When you've chosen to use a locally-intalled node local to ST, then any
  possible subprocess spawned by the language server should use *that* local
  node executable as well.
  The same problem is also present for pip-based helper packages like LSP-pylsp.
