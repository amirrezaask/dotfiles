GitSavvy 2.25.0
===============

- Improve historical "file view"

  When you look at a specific revision of a file (for example via
  `git: show current file at commit`) we now show diff markers in the gutter
  area.

  Use `[p]`/`[n]` to switch to a newer or older version of that file.  You
  can also open an "inline diff" from here, using the Command Palette or
  preferable a key binding.

  A more typical work-flow to such a file revision is from a "graph view",
  either the `git: Repo History` or `git: File History`: press `[o]` to show
  the full commit, and then on a specific hunk `[o]` again to show the
  complete file at that revision.

- You can now generally switch from the "normal" diff view to the
  "inline diff".  This is useful if you want to see more of the context of a
  hunk. Esp. it enables you to stage single lines of a hunk which is still
  not implemented for the "normal" diff.
