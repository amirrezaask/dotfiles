GitSavvy 2.20.0
===============

- GitSavvy moved to https://github.com/timbrel/GitSavvy

- Improve parsing and colorization of diffs in "word-diff" mode. Use
  `<w>` to enter that mode as usual.

- Improve the stash view. 
  Enter the stash view e.g. from the status dashboard via `<t><s>`. While
  looking at the stash try `<?>` for help, or just `<enter>` to see the 
  available, typical actions.

- Renovate the standard status view to fix a lot of small edge cases. Esp.
  improve the cursor jumping while staging/unstaging etc.

- Fix newline handling on Windows when .gitignoring files. (@joreiff)

We now ship code to reload the plugin after updates automatically and silently. 
This will be in full effect for the very next update you see.
