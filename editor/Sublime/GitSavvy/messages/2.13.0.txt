Hi everyone,

I'm happy to announce that Pavel Savchenko (@asfaltboy) and Randy Lai (@randy3k) have joined the GitSavvy team as official collaborators.  That means they'll be helping to address issues, implement features, and push out new releases.  Thanks for joining the team, guys!

Thanks also to Simon Toivo (@stoivo) for all his help over the last months as my first official collaborator - the project (and I) would have suffered without your help.

There are lots of bug fixes and enhancements in this release.  As always, reach out to us on Gitter[0] or by opening an issue [1] if you encounter problems.

Changes since 2.12.1:

  Features:
   - `git: clone` command.
   - `git: fixup from stage` and `git: quick stage current file and fixup` commands.
   - `git: compare against ...` and `git: compare current file against ...` commands.
   - Display diff between commits while in commit view with `f` key.
   - Soup-up `git: log` quick panel, allowing you to filter:
       + by the current branch,
       + by author,
       + or by another branch.
   - Soup-up `git: log` secondary quick panel, revealed once commit is selected.  You can now:
       + show the commit,
       + checkout the commit,
       + compare the commit against a branch or reference,
       + copy the full commit SHA,
       + diff the commit against the working directory, or
       + diff the commit against the cache.

  Enhancement:
   - Add keyboard navigation in diff and commit views.
   - Contextual pop-up help in the commit, diff, inline-diff, and commit comparison views.
   - Show commit in output panel when scrolling the `git: log` quick panel.
   - Add navication through conflicting files in Rebase dashboard.
   - Improve syntax highlighting for the graph view.
   - 
   - Allow user to select remote repo to act as base when utilizing various `github: ...` commands.
   - `github: open file on remote` can now open multiple files at once.
   - Add Vintageous-friendly navigation keys in various dashboards.

  Fix:

   - Cursor locations were sometimes incorrect when dashboards initially load.
   - Paths would not always resolve correctly when dealing with symlinked directories.

   - Files shown from the graph view would use the GitSavvy graph syntax.
   - Syntax irregularities in GitSavvy graph syntax file.
   - User was unable to stage/unstage files in Status dashboard when cursor was at the end of the row.
   - Merge commits were incorrectly filtered from `git: log` listing.
   - Quick stage did not handle merge conflicts well.
