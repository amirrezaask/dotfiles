GitSavvy 2.31.0
===============

- Revamped `git: clone` and `git: init`

  Both commands now find sane root folders for the ".git" repository.

  For `git: clone`, we suggest a sibling folder of the current open folder in
  the side-bar, and if there is none we fallback to `~`.

  Try it!  Copy a URL from your browser, or for example

      `https://github.com/timbrel/GitSavvy/blob/master/README.md`

  Open a new window (`ctrl+shift+n`), open the Command Palette (`ctrl+p`),
  `git: clone`.  And just leave the defaults.

  The idea is:  Whenever you read code on GitHub, and it's getting complicated,
  grab it and read it in Sublime instead.  You can "Go To Definition"s back and
  forth way faster.


Want to contribute back?

It's actually easy.  Here's the workflow:  `checkout new branch` (`cnb`), edit,
then commit as usual.  `create fork`, `create pull request` (`cpr`).  Done.
