GitSavvy 2.28.0
===============

- Improvements to the Diff View

  The standard diff view now supports staging, unstaging, or discarding
  selections, for example single lines, and whole files.

  In consistency with the other views we bind `[sud]` to stage, unstage,
  or discard one hunk or the concrete selection.  This works with multiple
  cursors and selections as well.

  Use the uppercase keys `[SUD]` to operate on whole files.

  "Zooming", t.i. changing how many context lines are shown, via `[+-]` has
  been greatly improved.  It's actually useable and useful now.

  **Tip**  If you want to stage several single lines from the same chunk,
  it is recommended to make use of multiple selections.  We take that as a
  hint on which lines actually belong together and form symmetrical
  modifications.


With this release we start to ship a series of refactorings as well.  As a
result, a few settings have been removed:

- `live_panel_output` and `live_panel_output_timeout` as the feature has
  been reimplemented.  We now always update the panel "live" if possible.

- `close_panel_for` as this feature was poorly implemented.

- `show_input_in_output`, `show_stdin_in_output`, `show_time_elapsed_in_output`

You should not use them anymore and remove them from your user settings file.
