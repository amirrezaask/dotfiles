I want to give a big thank-you to Pavel, Randy, and Simon for all of their work on GitSavvy.  I've been busy on other projects, and they've been managing PRs and moving things forward significantly.

Here are the changes since 2.13.0:

  New feature:
   - `git: show current file at commit`
   - Proper `git: clone` support.

  Enhancement:
   - Improved keyboard navigation in dashboards.
   - Improved git-log functionality.
   - Enable preservation of merges while rebasing.
   - New shortcuts in the Bransh dashboard.
   - Add pagination to various palette commands.
   - Better status information when rebasing.
   - Include merge hash in changelog generation.
   - `git: push` asynchronously.
   - Status updates when pulling/pushing.

  Bug fixes:
   - Sidebar refresh tweaks.

And several small tweaks, bug fixes, and internal refactors!
