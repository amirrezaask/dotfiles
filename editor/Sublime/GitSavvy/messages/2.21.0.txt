GitSavvy 2.21.0
===============

- We now highlight intra-line differences when we show git-diffs. 
  https://github.com/timbrel/GitSavvy/pull/1220

  For the annonations we use the scopes "diff.inserted.char.git-savvy.diff" 
  and "diff.deleted.char.git-savvy.diff". These are the same scopes
  Sublime uses for their "Incremental Diff" feature (but namespaced with
  ".git-savvy.diff") so every user should see proper colors right 
  away.
