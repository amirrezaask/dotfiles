Changes since 2.8.1:

  Feature:
   - `git: log current file` now has an option to view file at chosen commit.commit
   - Add `git: push all tags` command.
   - New `git: smart tag` commands for easy semantic versioning.
   - Directly checkout or view diff of GitHub pull requests with `github: review pull request`.
   - Basic support for opening new GitHub pull request from GitSavvy.

  Enhancement:
   - User is prompted for reset type (with hints) after running `git: reset`.

  Fix:
   - Editing commit message would fail if previous content deleted before new content entered.
   - Dashboards would not refresh after commit if commit_on_close enabled.
   - GitSavvy would attempt to open untracked file on remote.
   - Pushing a single tag would not work in tag dashboard.
   - `git: fetch` could not fetch commit directly.
   - Unclear destructive-action prompt for status-dashboard `D`.
   - Endless loop when some poor soul tries to diff a binary file as text.
   - Rebase dashboard failed if no directories added to active window.
   - Incorrect syntax highlighting in docs/README.md
   - Inline-diff view would sometimes jump to the right after staging hunks.
   - Refresh command in status dashboard was incorrectly wired-up.

  Other:
   - Add a GitSavvy diff syntax witch supports word diffs.
