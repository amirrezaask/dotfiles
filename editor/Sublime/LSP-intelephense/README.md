# LSP-intelephense

PHP support for Sublime's LSP plugin provided through [intelephense](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intelephense).

- Install [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) and [LSP-intelephense](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP-intelephense) from Package Control.
- Restart Sublime.

## Configuration

Configure the intelephense language server by accessing `Preferences > Package Settings > LSP > Servers > LSP-intelephense`.

## Server issues

Language server related bugs report [here](https://github.com/bmewburn/vscode-intelephense).

> NOTE: This plugin wouldn't be possible if intelephense didn't exist. So if you find it useful, support the [man](https://github.com/bmewburn) who took the time to make it. Star it on [github](https://github.com/bmewburn/intelephense-docs), or show you appreciation by buying the [licence](https://intelephense.com/) (and enjoy premium features).
