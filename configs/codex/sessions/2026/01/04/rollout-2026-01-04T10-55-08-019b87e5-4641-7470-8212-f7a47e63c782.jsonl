Each chunk should be:\n   - Self-contained and independently verifiable\n   - Small enough to review quickly\n   - Buildable without breaking existing functionality\n\n2. **Ask for Approval Before Each Chunk**: Before implementing each chunk:\n   - Clearly describe what will be changed\n   - Explain the expected outcome\n   - Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding\n\n3. **Validate After Each Chunk**: After completing each chunk:\n   - Run tests to ensure all tests pass\n   - Run linter to ensure code quality\n   - Only proceed to the next chunk if the current one is fully validated\n\n4. **Never Batch Multiple Chunks**: Do not combine multiple logical changes into a single step. Each approval cycle should cover exactly one chunk of work.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n- **Explicit over implicit**: Be clear about what code does. No magic, no hidden behavior.\n- **Simplicity over cleverness**: Prefer straightforward solutions. If it's hard to explain, it's probably wrong.\n- **Handle every error**: Check every assumption and handle every edge case.\n- **Composition over complexity**: Build solutions from small, well-tested pieces.\n- **Fail fast, fail loud**: Surface problems immediately rather than hiding them.\n\n--- project-doc ---\n\n## Skills\nThese skills are discovered at startup from multiple local sources.

These are the sources of truth; skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description, you must use that skill for that turn.

In `configs/nvim/init.lua` the colors block reads `TERM_BACKGROUND` (expects `light`/`dark`; falls back to current `vim.o.background`), sets `vim.o.background`, and loads `tokyonight-day` for light or `onedark` for dark. Existing `onedark`/`tokyonight` setups remain; the unconditional `onedark` load was removed so the light path isn’t overridden.\n\nNext steps: set `TERM_BACKGROUND=light` in your terminal env when you want the light theme; omit or set to `dark` to keep the dark theme."}]}}
