# ZSH
My own zsh configuration, no oh-my-zsh anymore :)


# Plugins
All plugins are in $ZSH_PLUGINS_DIR.(by default in '~/.local/zsh/plugins')
just clone anything you want and add the name to PLUGINS array.
## Todo
- Make getting plugin source implicit []

# Include
all other non-plugin scripts you want to run after plugin
