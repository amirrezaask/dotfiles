#+TITLE: Amirreza Computing Environment
My configurations are a set of org files that get tangled into right locations for different programs.

- [[file:Emacs.org][Emacs]]
- [[file:./ghostty/config][Ghostty]]
- [[file:ZSH.org][ZSH]]
- [[file:Tmux.org][Tmux]]
- [[file:Git.org][Git]]
- [[file:Fish.org][Fish]]

** Rebuild my system
Since I have all my configurations as org files, I can do a refresh with just this simple code block
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (dolist (file (directory-files "~/src/github/dotfiles" t "\\.org\\'"))
    (org-babel-tangle-file file))
#+end_src
