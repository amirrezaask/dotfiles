# Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This collection represents my personalized development environment, crafted for efficiency, minimalism, and productivity. These dotfiles are tailored to my workflow, emphasizing lightweight tools and configurations without bloat. Whether you're looking for inspiration or want to adopt parts of this setup, this README will guide you through the philosophy and usage.

## Philosophy

My dotfiles are built around the following principles:
- **Minimalism**: Only include what's necessary to keep the setup fast and clean.
- **Performance**: Avoid sluggish frameworks (e.g., no Oh My Zsh) and prioritize lightweight tools.
- **Portability**: Easy to set up on new systems with minimal dependencies.
- **Customizability**: Configurations are modular and easy to tweak for personal use.

The core components include:
- **Shell**: Zsh with a handful of auto-installed plugins for functionality without overhead.
- **Editor**: Neovim, configured in a minimal, high-performance style inspired by ThePrimeagen.
- **Terminal**: Ghostty for a modern, lightweight terminal experience.

## Components

### Zsh
I use Zsh as my shell for its flexibility and powerful features. Instead of heavy frameworks like Oh My Zsh, I rely on a lean `.zshrc` with a curated set of auto-installed plugins. These provide essential functionality like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and git integration without slowing down the shell.

### Neovim
My Neovim setup is inspired by ThePrimeagen's philosophy of keeping things fast and minimal. The configuration (`init.lua`) includes only the essentials: a lightweight plugin manager, keybindings for productivity, and a clean, distraction-free interface. No bloated LSP setups or unnecessary pluginsâ€”just a focused editing experience.

### Ghostty
Ghostty is my terminal of choice for its modern design, performance, and simplicity. The configuration tweaks fonts, colors, and keybindings to complement my workflow.
