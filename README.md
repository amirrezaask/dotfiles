# Dotfiles
My Personal linux setup, an opinionated hyperland setup.
Scripts and overall configurations are heavily inspired by [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) by [DHH](https://github.com/dhh), Unlike Omarchy this setup works on ubuntu and in some parts is less opinionated and more vanilla.

## Installation

### Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirreza/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
./linux/ubuntu.sh # for ubuntu/mint
./bin/setup-lins #  sets up configuration symlinks
```
