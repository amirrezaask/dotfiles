# Dotfiles
My Personal linux setup, an opinionated hyperland/sway setup.
Scripts and overall configurations are heavily inspired by [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) by [DHH](https://github.com/dhh), Unlike Omarchy this setup is distro agnostic and in some parts is less opinionated and more vanilla.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amirreza/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./sync
```

### Supported Distributions
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
- [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)
