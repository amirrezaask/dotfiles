# AmirrezaAsk Configs
Simple configurations for Neovim and Emacs, I tend to use both, I like them both and they both have their own pros/cons, in short Emacs is easier to extend but neovim is much much faster. 

## Configs

- [Neovim](https://github.com/amirrezaask/dotfiles/blob/master/nvim-init.lua)
