# AmirrezaAsk Configs
My dotfile repository used to be a giant repo with configurations for all sorts of programs, but now it's just config for one program ( Emacs ), some basic fonts and some basic scripts for different systems.

## Configs

- [Neovim](https://github.com/amirrezaask/nvim)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/amirrezaask/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs)

## Resources

- [Emacs Download](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/)
- [Neovim Building Docs](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim)
