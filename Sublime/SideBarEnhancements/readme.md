# Side Bar Enhancements

## Description

Sidebar menu for Sublime Text. Notably provides delete as "move to trash", a
clipboard, and files affected by a rename/move command are closed, renamed/moved
and restored.

## Default Menu items

To get rid of the stock Sublime Text menuitems create two empty files on
"Preferences -> Browse Packages"

- `Default/Side Bar Mount Point.sublime-menu`
- `Default/Side Bar.sublime-menu`
