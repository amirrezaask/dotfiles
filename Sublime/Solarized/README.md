# Solarized

Solarized is a color scheme created by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). There are [versions](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) for pretty much every editor out there, this is the one to get for Sublime Text.

## Solarized for Sublime Text

This package is both a color scheme (ie. syntax highlight for code), and a UI theme, created especially for Sublime Text.  

To install it, use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Solarized%20Color%20Scheme).
