GitSavvy 2.39.0
===============


| Likely the last version working with Sublime Text 3.  If you're still using that |
| freeze your GitSavvy install.                                                    |


- This version implements `[n]`ext/`[p]`revious navigation for the inline diff and
the commit views including the commit panel at the bottom of the graph views.

E.g., you could open the inline diff for a given file, then `[p][O]` to see
the last revision of that exact file.

- @zebyja implemented variable expansion especially for the custom env/PATH setting.
E.g. in your GitSavvy settings:

```
{
    "env": {
        "PATH":"venv/bin:${PATH}"
    },
}
```

to *prepend* `venv/bin`.  (#1724)
