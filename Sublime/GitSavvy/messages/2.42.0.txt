GitSavvy 2.42.0
===============

This release mostly consists of bug- and glitch-fixes you might not even noticed.

Few notable changes:

- GitSavvy's output panel now supports progress information.  This was trickier than I thought it
  would get, and especially makes "cloning" or "rebasing" much nicer to look at.

- In the commit view, "select all" (e.g. `ctrl+a`) now selects just your commit message and not the
  help text and diff below anymore.  That only applies when the cursor is within the message of
  course.  `ctrl+a` twice will still select the whole buffer.

- Forking a GitHub repository will now by default only copy the default branch.  This is
  explained on their blog (https://github.blog/changelog/2022-07-27-you-can-now-fork-a-repo-and-copy-only-the-default-branch/).
  However, this is also pluggable, please refer to GitSavvy's settings (https://github.com/timbrel/GitSavvy/commit/aa555a22#diff-96ea80b9a1df2392ccf6a341d0375dd230076a620a236c127f7980c15c2ab5f8).
