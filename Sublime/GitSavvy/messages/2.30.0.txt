GitSavvy 2.30.0
===============

Two simple, quality-of-life improvements:

- Open an GitHub issue or PR in the browser

  Whenever you see a link to an issue, for example looking at the Repo
  History or an individual commit, either hover over it to open a popup,
  or place the cursor on it and hit `[o]` to open the issue/PR page in
  your browser.  (#1483)


- Simplify wizard when pushing to a remote

  When pushing a branch to a remote the first time, for example prior
  to creating a PR on GitHub, we now guess a good remote and assume you
  don't want to have a different branch name than the local one on the
  remote.  (#1475)


Notable

- For compatibility with the new Sublime Text 4, introduce syntax and
  settings for the basic output panel.  And while we're at it, add some
  color touch.  (#1484)
- Correctly find and resolve `git_dir` for *workspaces*.  (#1477)
- Refactor how we update the workdir status and update the status dashboard
  in the background.  Basically introducing a *reactive* framework.  (#1478)


Tip: Subscribe to the GitSavvy "releases" on GitHub to get a notification
about a new version, and not be surprised on the next Sublime restart.
