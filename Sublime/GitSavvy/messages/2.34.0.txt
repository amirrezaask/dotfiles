GitSavvy 2.34.0
===============

Small things matter!

- Add fixup helpers (bound to `[f]`) to the `diff`, `inline-diff`, and
  `Line History`.  (#1567)

- In the `Commit View` and `Line History` bind `[h]` to open the commit on
  GitHub in the browser.  Also add a clickable annotation in the top right
  corner.  (#1570)

- For `github: open file on remote`, usually open the last-modified revision
  of the file.  (#1571)

- Automatically treat spaces as `-` (dashes) when asking for a new branch
  name.  (#1557)

- Add command to Command Palette (`git: rename current branch`) to rename
  the current, active branch.  (#1558)

- Add command `git: unset tracking branch` to remove the tracking information
  of the current branch  (#1559)

- Allow deletion of the currently checked out ("active") branch.  (#1560)

- Smooth(er), incidental drawing of the log graph view.  (#1569)

  Indicate visually that we wait for a response from `git log graph` if it
  takes too long, or that we await and expect a complete re-draw (typical
  because a filter setting changed).

- Make filenames clickable in views where we show patches.  (#1556)

- Mark the commit message view as lintable by SublimeLinter.  (#1566)
