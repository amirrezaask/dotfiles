GitSavvy 2.41.0
===============

Minor, quality-of-life improvements

- Improved cursor placement after staging, unstaging, etc., in the diff view for better orientation.
- When transitioning from a normal view (buffer) to the diff view, the just edited hunk is now
  placed and shown automatically (if applicable).  We had this for the inline diff view like
  forever and now also for the standard diff view.  This is even more interesting if you added a
  key binding

```
  {
      "keys": ["ctrl+shift+."],
      "command": "gs_diff",
      "args": { "current_file": true }
  },
```



Less minor

In the commit message view, you can now unstage directly even in the `-a` (all) mode, completing this feature set.

In the Repo History (graph) views,

- an overview mode has been added, triggered by pressing `[s]`. This mode hides all commits and
  only displays branch tips and reachable tags. (In this mode, pressing `[a]` will also hide the
  tags!)
- an asterisk (`*`) after `HEAD` now indicates that the repository is currently dirty. For example,
  it will print `(HEAD* -> master)` now.  😐😏
- Special branches in a repository are now marked with a special syntax scope, allowing you to
  assign a different color to them. The branch names that are considered special are:
  `(master|main|dev|trunk)\b`, and the scope is named
  `constant.other.git.branch.special.git-savvy`.
  Note that you need to adjust your color scheme to see any change; GitSavvy will not modify it
  automatically.
