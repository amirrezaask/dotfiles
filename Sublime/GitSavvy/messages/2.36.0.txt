GitSavvy 2.36.0
===============

Insane refactorings went into this one.  And you don't even see them.
Well, 🤞, at least I hope so.

Still some user facing things of course:

- Re-designed the "git: tag" dashboard

- In the "Repo History" it is now possible to fast-forward a branch.

  Say you're on a feature branch checked out, and you know that e.g.
  your "main" branch moved.

  You can now just select the main branch, hit `[enter]` for the menu,
  and select `Fast forward 'main' to 'origin/main'` if you already
  fetched a new tip.  Otherwise it says `Update 'main' from 'origin/main'`
  and fetches first before moving the branch.

  You stay on the feature branch during that process, and can rebase
  immediately after that.

  Very useful.


Some of you might love and even rely on this little package GitSavvy,
and I do drink coffee just like others.  If that's a match consider
